                    <p class="text2">Gaming is the new "pub" for friends.Over the last few years ive rekindled my fast fingers and picked up the new controllers, before turning my hand to w,a,s,d....what have i done!<br> ive found out about discord the hidden traven on the internet, full of charcters, good and bad. In my circle at the moment am known as the lifer, descripied by others as the middle age man who cant shout, helps in other ways and just enjoys the banter. Dont let the name fool you, snipers dream is because my charcters all must have big heads becasue am a dream for them...plus the fact these old fingers press stand up instead of lie down.  </p>

                <h4>The Mind Boggles</h4>
                <p>I was bought up on jigsaws, nothing a good jigsaw couldnt cure on a sunday afternoon at grannies with a sunday roast.So was natural my son was going to get the same, esp with the amount of rain the northwest of england brings.<br>My lad actually likes them aswell, so i failed there really, never mind it will come in good for the great electricity shortage of 2035.
                <br>This brings me to wasjig, a jigsaw with a differance (no thats not spelt wrong i know coding as made forget my england but its right) the jigsaws dont have an aswer on the box, so you cant see what your building, you only get to see the people looking at the answer on the box.very little clues, onlt 4 on and around the box, the rest is guess work. there are always bright and colourful and easy on the eye, but a real pain to solve must times.</p>

                <h4>Maybe its Broke? Maybe it Comes Like That?</h4>
                <p>Airfix is the brand which brings you scale model building of scene you create. I mainly work in scales of 1/72 and 1/35, when i was a child these where actual toys, yes build your own, i know madness hey kids.I mainly like to  depict war scenes as that leaves room for errors as its not to be nice and clean. I started to pick this back up a few years ago and it killed a good few nights during lockdown.</p>
