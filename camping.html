        <p class="textcamp2">Building dens on the field or in your mates backyard, camping out in them and learning they wasnt waterproof, getting found out of mum but still doing it again. Camping has changed alot since i started with some poles and some string. I love the outdoors, enjoying walks and completing the 3 peaks challenage of ben nevis scafell pike and snowdonin 24hrs, really want to do them again,but slower and maybe not at night.<br><br>With all the mod cons now avaialbe camping is the in thing, they can thank people like me for that for buying the tent that leaked until tech previlled.The joys of camping are still there they just make it easier for all to enjoy now</p>
